        <h2>Career Breakthrough</h2>
        <p>
            Ahmed's journey into content creation began in 2012 while he was still a student. Noticing a lack of Arabic educational 
            content online, he started a YouTube channel named "Droos Online" to provide tutorials on software like Photoshop and After Effects. 
            After graduating in 2014, he worked as a civil engineer in Marsa Alam but continued to nurture his passion for content creation. 
            In 2017, he made the pivotal decision to become a full-time YouTuber. His channel expanded to cover topics such as 
            English language learning, productivity, and self-development, amassing nearly 7 million subscribers by 2022.
